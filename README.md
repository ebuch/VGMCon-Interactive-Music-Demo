This is my example project from my technical talk "Interactive Music in Unreal Engine." It includes examples of basic building blocks of interactive music set up using MetaSounds. For educational use only. For presentation slides and other info, [visit my website](https://ericbuchholz.com/vgm-con-2023-presentation/).

Created with Unreal Engine 5.2 Preview 2.
